### Hello.

âš¡ My name is DD. This is my space to show off my hobbyist projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my TikTok account with over 150,000 followers.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new visual novel engine, for intermediate to advanced game developers. This will be based on the MonoGame framework, and should be able to target Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Watch this space for more things to come.
